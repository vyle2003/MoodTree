# MoodTree

Project Description: 

We make a Mood Tracker Website Called MoodTree. This website will ask the User about the Mood of the Day and a Description of Today’s Feeling. This app also includes a Working Calendar, in which Users can create Events to boost their Productivity and Mood to become a Better Person.
The Color scheme: and Theme are based on a leaf, which demonstrates how Moods can change like a leaf would be easily blown out. 

File Structure:

	FRONTEND:
The Login is the starting page of the website (index.html)
The Sign Up page is the secondary page in case, the User doesn’t have the account. 
The Main page is where the Users, will be able to input their Moods, as well as their Feelings. 
The Calendar page is the page where Users will be able to add Events or Tasks.
 The assets folder stores all of the images for the websites. 
All of the Frontend Files are stored under src/main/resources/public.

	BACKEND: 

The project was done on Intellij JDK 17 	
We created a database for login and signin to store user’s authentication
The database also stores the user’s mood and their description of how they are feeling with the timestamp when they hit submit 
Spent most of our time to debug and work with database

How to run the application:
1. Make sure it is on JDK 17 version
2. Run the application
3. run localhost:8080
4. Sign-up or log_in
5. Enjoy!! 

Order of Operations: 
Create your account by pressing the “Sign up” button.
On the main page, users can check today’s date. First, users should choose the colour of the leaf depending on their mood on that day.
After that, users can write their feelings in “Today’s Note”.
Click the submit button.
Users can check the history of your records(feelings) in the calendar. 
When you click the drop-down menu on the main page, you can see the “calendar” and “sign out” options.
